# Prevent udev from autoloading virtio_gpu during early boot.
# Plymouth renders on simpledrm (the UEFI framebuffer). If virtio_gpu loads
# while Plymouth is running, it unbinds simpledrm via drm_aperture cleanup
# and Plymouth loses its rendering target (virtio_gpu has -host_visible,
# so Plymouth can't mmap its dumb buffers either).
#
# The load-virtio-gpu.service explicitly loads this module after Plymouth
# quits, in time for Cage/Wayland compositors that need it.
